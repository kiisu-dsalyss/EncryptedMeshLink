# EncryptedMeshLink Architecture

## üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLE

**THE DISCOVERY SERVICE IS ONLY FOR PEER DISCOVERY - NO MESSAGES GO THROUGH IT!**

This is fundamental to the architecture and must never be violated.

## Correct Architecture

### Discovery Service (PHP)
- **Purpose**: Find other stations only
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /discovery.php` - Register station
  - `GET /discovery.php?peers=true` - Get peer list
  - `DELETE /discovery.php?station_id=X` - Unregister
  - `GET /discovery.php?health=true` - Health check
- **Does NOT handle**: Messages, message relay, message storage
- **Location**: Your web hosting (shared hosting compatible)

### Direct P2P Messaging (To Be Implemented in MIB-010)
- **Purpose**: Station-to-station message delivery
- **Method**: Direct TCP/WebSocket connections between stations
- **Process**:
  1. Station A uses discovery service to find Station B's contact info
  2. Station A establishes direct connection to Station B
  3. Station A sends message directly to Station B
  4. No messages go through discovery service

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- Discovery service for peer finding
- Local mesh relay within each station
- Node Registry for cross-station node tracking
- Enhanced command structure ("status" vs "nodes")

### üö® Incorrectly Implemented (Fixed with warnings)
- ~~Bridge transport trying to poll discovery service for messages~~ ‚Üí DISABLED
- ~~Bridge transport trying to send messages through discovery service~~ ‚Üí DISABLED

### üöß To Be Implemented (MIB-010)
- Direct P2P connections between stations
- Message relay over P2P connections
- NAT traversal for home networks
- Connection pooling and management

## Architecture Violations to Avoid

### ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:
```typescript
// WRONG: Using discovery service for messages
fetch(`${discoveryUrl}?messages=${stationId}`) // BAD!
fetch(`${discoveryUrl}?relay=true`, { method: 'POST' }) // BAD!
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH:
```typescript
// 1. Use discovery service to find peers
const peers = await discoveryClient.getPeers();

// 2. Establish direct P2P connection 
const connection = await p2pClient.connect(targetStation);

// 3. Send message directly
await connection.sendMessage(message);
```

## Component Responsibilities

### Discovery Client (`src/discoveryClient.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Register this station with discovery service
- ‚úÖ Fetch list of peer stations
- ‚úÖ Maintain heartbeat registration
- ‚ùå NEVER send/receive user messages

### Bridge Transport (`src/bridge/transport.ts`)
- üöß Establish direct P2P connections (MIB-010)
- üöß Send messages over P2P connections (MIB-010)
- üöß Handle connection failures and retry logic (MIB-010)
- ‚ùå NEVER use discovery service for message relay

### Enhanced Relay Handler (`src/enhancedRelayHandler.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Route messages within local mesh
- ‚úÖ Integrate with Node Registry for cross-station visibility
- ‚úÖ Handle "status" and "nodes" commands
- üöß Route messages to remote stations via P2P (MIB-010)

### Node Registry (`src/nodeRegistry/`)
- ‚úÖ Track nodes across stations
- ‚úÖ Store node metadata and availability
- ‚úÖ Provide cross-station node visibility
- ‚úÖ Handle node synchronization between stations

## Message Flow

### Local Messages (Working)
```
Meshtastic Device ‚Üí Enhanced Relay Handler ‚Üí Local Meshtastic Device
```

### Remote Messages (Future - MIB-010)
```
Meshtastic Device ‚Üí Enhanced Relay Handler ‚Üí P2P Connection ‚Üí Remote Station ‚Üí Remote Device
```

### Discovery (Working)
```
Station A ‚Üí Discovery Service ‚Üê Station B
         (find peer info only)
```

## Key Files

- `discovery-service/discovery.php` - Peer discovery only
- `src/discoveryClient.ts` - Registration and peer lookup
- `src/bridge/transport.ts` - P2P transport (placeholder, warnings added)
- `src/bridge/client.ts` - P2P client interface (disabled polling)
- `src/enhancedRelayHandler.ts` - Main message routing logic
- `src/nodeRegistry/` - Cross-station node tracking

## Development Guidelines

1. **Always remember**: Discovery service = peer discovery only
2. **Before implementing messaging**: Think "is this going P2P or through discovery?"
3. **If it's through discovery**: You're doing it wrong
4. **Test architecture**: Can the discovery service be offline and messages still work between connected stations? If no, architecture is wrong.

## Next Steps (MIB-010)

1. Implement WebSocket/TCP P2P connections
2. Connection establishment and handshake
3. NAT traversal for home networks
4. Message encryption over P2P channels
5. Connection pooling and management
6. Failover and retry logic

**Remember: Discovery finds peers, P2P delivers messages. Never mix these!**
