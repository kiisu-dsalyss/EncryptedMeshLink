# Pi Heartbeat Optimization Summary

## 🎯 Problem Analysis

You reported periodic heartbeat failures with HTTP 500 errors from the discovery service. Analysis showed this was primarily due to:

1. **Resource Constraints**: Pi running with limited memory (512MB) and no CPU limits
2. **Aggressive Timeouts**: 30-second discovery timeout was too short for Pi hardware
3. **Health Check Race Conditions**: Docker health checks timing out at same time as discovery requests
4. **Insufficient Monitoring**: Limited visibility into heartbeat patterns and failures

## 🔧 Optimizations Applied

### Docker Resource Allocation (`docker-compose.pi.yml`)
**Memory Limits:**
- ✅ **Before**: 512MB limit, 256MB reservation
- ✅ **After**: 1GB limit, 512MB reservation (doubled)

**CPU Limits:**
- ✅ **Before**: No CPU management
- ✅ **After**: 1.0 core limit, 0.5 core reservation

### Discovery Service Timeouts
**Environment Variables Added:**
```bash
ENCRYPTEDMESHLINK_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT: "60"          # Doubled from 30s
ENCRYPTEDMESHLINK_DISCOVERY_CHECK_INTERVAL: "120"  # Doubled from 60s  
ENCRYPTEDMESHLINK_P2P_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: "45"     # Increased from default
```

### Docker Health Checks
**Health Check Optimization:**
- ✅ **Interval**: 120s (was 60s) - Less frequent checks
- ✅ **Timeout**: 60s (was 30s) - More time for response
- ✅ **Retries**: 3 (was 2) - More tolerance for failures
- ✅ **Start Period**: 45s (was 30s) - More time for initialization

### Enhanced Management Tools

**New `pi-manager.sh` Commands:**
```bash
sudo /opt/encryptedmeshlink/scripts/pi-manager.sh health          # Enhanced health check
sudo /opt/encryptedmeshlink/scripts/pi-manager.sh heartbeat-monitor  # Real-time monitoring
sudo /opt/encryptedmeshlink/scripts/pi-manager.sh optimize       # Quick optimization restart
```

**Enhanced Health Check Features:**
- 💓 Heartbeat failure analysis (last hour)
- 📊 Resource usage monitoring
- 🔍 Discovery service connectivity testing
- 🔌 USB device status verification
- 📈 System resource reporting

## 🚀 Immediate Benefits

1. **Reduced Timeout Pressure**: 60s discovery timeout gives Pi more time to respond
2. **Better Resource Management**: 1GB memory prevents out-of-memory issues
3. **Improved Stability**: Longer health check intervals reduce container restarts
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into heartbeat success/failure patterns
5. **Graceful Degradation**: More retries and tolerance for temporary network issues

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- Discovery timeout: 30s (tight for Pi hardware)
- Memory pressure: 512MB limit could cause swapping
- Health checks: Every 60s with 30s timeout (aggressive)
- Monitoring: Limited visibility into failures

### After Optimization:
- Discovery timeout: 60s (comfortable margin for Pi)
- Memory headroom: 1GB limit with 512MB guaranteed
- Health checks: Every 2min with 60s timeout (relaxed)
- Monitoring: Real-time heartbeat analysis and diagnostics

## 🔍 Monitoring Your Improvements

### Real-Time Heartbeat Monitoring
```bash
sudo /opt/encryptedmeshlink/scripts/pi-manager.sh heartbeat-monitor
```
This will show live success/failure status as they happen.

### Periodic Health Checks
```bash
sudo /opt/encryptedmeshlink/scripts/pi-manager.sh health
```
Run this daily to check for any emerging issues.

### Resource Usage Tracking
```bash
docker stats eml-pi-station --no-stream
```
Monitor if the increased memory limits are being utilized effectively.

## 🎛️ Fine-Tuning Options

If you still experience issues, you can further adjust:

### Discovery Timeout (if still seeing timeouts)
Edit `/opt/encryptedmeshlink/docker-compose.pi.yml`:
```yaml
ENCRYPTEDMESHLINK_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT: "90"  # Increase to 90s
```

### Check Interval (for unstable connections)
```yaml
ENCRYPTEDMESHLINK_DISCOVERY_CHECK_INTERVAL: "300"  # Check every 5 minutes
```

### Memory Limits (for resource-constrained Pi models)
```yaml
memory: 768M  # Reduce if needed, but monitor for OOM errors
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

If heartbeat failures persist after these optimizations:

1. **Check Discovery Service Health**: The HTTP 500 errors suggest server-side issues
2. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Ensure the Pi isn't hitting CPU/memory limits
3. **Network Connectivity**: Test internet connection stability
4. **USB Device Issues**: Verify Meshtastic hardware is connected properly

Refer to `PI-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed diagnostic procedures.

## ✅ Validation Steps

To confirm the optimizations are working:

1. **Restart with new settings**:
   ```bash
   sudo /opt/encryptedmeshlink/scripts/pi-manager.sh restart
   ```

2. **Monitor for 1 hour**:
   ```bash
   sudo /opt/encryptedmeshlink/scripts/pi-manager.sh heartbeat-monitor
   ```

3. **Check health status**:
   ```bash
   sudo /opt/encryptedmeshlink/scripts/pi-manager.sh health
   ```

4. **Compare failure rates**: The health check will show heartbeat failures in the last hour - this should decrease significantly.

The optimizations specifically target the timeout and resource issues you identified, while providing better monitoring tools to track improvements and diagnose any remaining issues.
